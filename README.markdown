ABC iView plugin for XBMC
================================

This plugin provides a simple list of available programs from the ABC iView 
web site, and allows you to stream them with.

The content is only available with Australia, or you can apparently use sites
like Unblock-US or your own VPN solution which terminates in with an AU IP 
address.

This plugin wouldn't be possible without the great work on python-iview from
Jeremy Visser.
